# EDA--Google-Paly-Store--project
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 10,000+ web-scraped Google Play Store apps. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I cleaned and processed raw data to uncover trends in the Android market, focusing on app categories, ratings, and pricing models.
